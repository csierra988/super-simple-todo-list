# super simple to do list!

## This is exactly what it says it is... a super simple to do list! 

I've been following along with spring guides to aid with learning spring with java, however I wanted to do a really simple project, thus super simple to do list was born. I also decided to experiment with tailwind as well since I'm not the most familiar with it, but I do enjoy reducing the number of necessary css files if I can!
